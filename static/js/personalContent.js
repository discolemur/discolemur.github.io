I grew up on the western edge of the Rocky Mountains. Now, living in the Mid-West, I miss the imposing peaks and dry, thin, mountain air.
Still, as I enter proper adulthood, I look forward to new surroundings and experiences. I've been to nine countries, lived abroad for a total of about two and a half years, and speak Mandarin Chinese at an intermediate level.
I maintain a diverse array of interests and hobbies. I weave chainmail jewelry and crochet ties. I casually play several instruments. My favorite painters are Vermeer and Renoir. I have a new favorite musician each month. I love learning about how the universe works, from the macro to micro. Above this paragraph is a composite image of the 2017 solar eclipse that I took through my telescope (no filter, except the moon).

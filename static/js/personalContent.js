I grew up on the western edge of the Rocky Mountains: hiking, fishing, camping, and running marathons in the shadow of imposing peaks through dry, thin, mountain air.
Now, studying in the mid-West, I look forward to new surroundings and experiences. I've been to nine countries, lived abroad for over two years, and have studied Hebrew and Mandarin.
Family, religion, and career are the most important parts of my life, and these consume most of my time. Still, I maintain a diverse array of interests and hobbies, and an ongoing project or two is always on my desk. Among my interests, I enjoy running, music, chainmaille, crochet, astronomy, programming, and electronics.

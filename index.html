<p>I studied phylotranscriptomics in <a href="http://bybeelab.byu.edu/">Dr. Seth Bybee's lab</a> from April 2014 to the present. In April 2015, I will graduate from <a href="http://home.byu.edu">Brigham Young University</a> (BYU) with a bachelor's degree in bioinformatics and minors in mathematics and computer science.</p>
<p>In my early days of college, I did some simple mathematics research with Ore's Closure on Hamiltonian graphs. At the <a href="http://cpms.byu.edu/about/spring-research-conference/submitted-abstracts/?yr=2013&id=1119">2013 BYU CPMS Student Research Conference</a>, I gave a short presentation on my research.</p>
<p>I have interests in evolutionary biology and phylogenetics. In the Bybee Lab, we have researched the evolution of opsin genes in dragonflies. My contribution has been the "babysitting" of transcriptome data through trimming, assembly, annotation, ortholog clustering, and tree construction. In this process, I have utilized multithreading in python to take advantage of the campus supercomputer. It is amazing how much faster a computer can gather data from 30,000 files in the same directory when it uses 32 threads! We are close to publishing a paper demonstrating a novel method for detecting false-positive homology. In the future, I hope to develop methods for inferring the gender of a specimen given a transcriptome. I plan on earning a PhD in Biology.</p>
<p>For fun, I wrote a small program to model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle#Deviations_from_Hardy.E2.80.93Weinberg_equilibrium">the effects of non-random mating</a> on allele frequencies in a simplistic population.</p>

<p>I like to say that people can do anything, if they give it a try. I've run marathons in the US and China. I've earned a high rating playing a clarinet solo at a state-level competition. I've built a chainmail shirt and coif. I've crocheted a doily. I've learned some Chinese and Hebrew, even living for a semester in an on-campus Hebrew-speaking apartment. I've helped remodel a kitchen. I've helped build a large deck. I've tracked the phases of Venus through a telescope, seen the rings around Saturn, and imaged the Orion Nebula. I've torched creme brulee and cooked a Baked Alaska. In my spare time, and for fun, I discovered trends in the masses of stable isotopes that support the nuclear shell model (I was a little disappointed when I found out the model has already been proposed.) I enjoy making chain jewelry.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself saying, "Dude, I wish I could do that!" then I say, do it!</p>

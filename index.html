<h3><a id="professional" class="anchor" href="#professional" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Professional Background</h3>
<p>I studied phylotranscriptomics in <a href="http://bybeelab.byu.edu/">Dr. Seth Bybee's lab</a> from April 2014 to the present. In April 2015, I will graduate from <a href="http://home.byu.edu">Brigham Young University</a> (BYU) with a bachelor's degree in bioinformatics and minors in mathematics and computer science.</p>
<p>In my early days of college, I did some simple mathematics research with Ore's Closure on Hamiltonian graphs. At the <a href="http://cpms.byu.edu/about/spring-research-conference/submitted-abstracts/?yr=2013&id=1119">2013 BYU CPMS Student Research Conference</a>, I gave a short presentation on my research.</p>
<p>I have interests in evolutionary biology and phylogenetics. In the Bybee Lab, we have researched the evolution of opsin genes in dragonflies. My contribution has been the "babysitting" of transcriptome data through trimming, assembly, annotation, ortholog clustering, and tree construction. In this process, I have utilized multithreading in python to take advantage of the campus supercomputer. It is amazing how much faster a computer can gather data from 30,000 files in the same directory when it uses 32 threads! Although I have only a little training in algorithm analysis, I am becoming skilled at choosing data structures that optimize for high speed or low memory. We are close to publishing a paper demonstrating a novel method for detecting false-positive homology. In the future, I hope to develop methods for inferring the gender of a specimen given a transcriptome.</p>
<p>For fun, I wrote a small program to model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle#Deviations_from_Hardy.E2.80.93Weinberg_equilibrium">the effects of non-random mating</a> on allele frequencies in a simplistic population.</p>

<p>I like to say that people can do anything, if they give it a try. I've run marathons in the US and China. I've earned a high rating playing a clarinet solo at a state-level competition. I've built a chainmail shirt and coif. I've crocheted a doily. I've learned some Chinese and Hebrew, even living for a semester in an on-campus Hebrew-speaking apartment. I've helped remodel a kitchen. I've helped build a large deck. I've tracked the phases of Venus through a telescope, seen the rings around Saturn, and imaged the Orion Nebula. I've torched creme brulee and cooked a Baked Alaska. In my spare time, and for fun, I discovered trends in the masses of stable isotopes that support the nuclear shell model (I was a little disappointed when I found out the model has already been proposed.) I enjoy making chain jewelry. If you ever find yourself saying "Dude, I wish I could do that!" then I say, do it!<p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
